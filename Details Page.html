<h1>Computer and Coding Program</h1>
  <p>FOA's Computer and Coding program is designed to teach students the basics of computer, programming and coding knowledge to help students develop the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century. The curriculum of the program is derived from Ghanaian basic school curriculum and focuses on practical aspect, which aids students academic improvement in ICT. The program is offered to students in grades 4-12 and is taught by Kingsley, a volunteer teacher from the community. The program is offered in English language, but the teacher sometimes uses Ewe languge when explaining certain things.</p>
  <p>The program is offered at FOA's Office (Good Life Center) and is open to all students. The teacher commutes from Tsriefe to Dawanu (one of the communities that has a computer lab) to teach students there. The program is offered free of charge to all students in six different communities.
